# Pass-or-Fail-Checker

This Python program checks whether a student has passed or failed based on their marks in three subjects: Maths, Physics, and Chemistry.

## 💡 What It Does

- Takes marks for Maths, Physics, and Chemistry as input from the user.
- Validates if any marks exceed 100.
- Determines if the student has passed by checking if all marks are at least 45.
- Prints "Pass" if all subjects meet the passing criteria; otherwise, prints "Not Pass".

## 📁 File

- `pass-fail.py`: Contains the program code.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python pass-fail.py
